# system_settings
Here I will provide some scripts/configs to easily set Ubuntu to my settings.

## How to install

Probably will work with:
```shell
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tikerlade/system_settings/main/setup_terminal.sh)"
```

## Step by step installation
On a new machine firstly install terminal tools:
```shell
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tikerlade/system_settings/main/install_terminal_tools.sh)"
```

After all tools have been installed we can configure them using:
```shell
sudo sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tikerlade/system_settings/main/configure_terminal_tools.sh)"
```
